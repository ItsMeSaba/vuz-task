2. Allow a user to filter the list of Characters
3. Allow a user to select up to 6 Characters
4. Show the selected Squad of Characters
5. Pay attention on performance

#### What's provided

This repository contains the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) boilerplate code using the TypeScript template, a CSS reset, and the Mortal Kombot logo image. It will be perfect if you can refactor it using FSD.

We've also put together a `.json` file containing all Character data (sourced from [DashFight](https://dashfight.com/) and [EventHubs](https://www.eventhubs.com/)) from various fighting games (Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and Dragon Ball Z). You can import this file directly into your code to complete the challenge. You'll find this in the `./src/data` directory. 

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING WITHIN THE DATA, ALL MUST BE DONE WITHOUT CHANGING `.json` FILE
